## Smart Contract Components

### Energy Token Contract
```solidity
contract EnergyToken {
    // Tokenize energy production
    function mintEnergyCredits(
        address producer, 
        uint256 energyAmount
    ) external returns (uint256 credits) {
        // Verification and minting logic
    }

    // Transfer energy credits
    function transferEnergy(
        address from, 
        address to, 
        uint256 amount
    ) external {
        // Secure energy credit transfer
    }
}
```

### Trading Marketplace Contract
```solidity
contract EnergyMarketplace {
    // Create energy trade order
    function createTradeOrder(
        uint256 energyAmount, 
        uint256 price
    ) external {
        // Order creation logic
    }

    // Execute peer-to-peer trade
    function executeTrade(
        uint256 orderId
    ) external {
        // Automated trade settlement
    }
}
```
